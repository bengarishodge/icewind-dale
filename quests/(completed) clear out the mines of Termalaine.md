A bunch of [[kobold]]s have invaded the mine of [[Termalaine]]. We also are tasked by [[Vellyn Harpelle]] to collect up the bodies and deliver them to her. There is a massive hole in the middle of the [[Termalaine Mine]].

We enter the mine into the dark mine. 

We find a room with hammers, picks and tracks. We continue in and see some gems in the wall and [[Bael]] knocks a few bits of rock. Nothing of value is mined. We find an underground river which is supported by natural stone pillars. 

We kill some rats in the river room. We try to cross a rickity bridge and are attacked by some [[kobold]]s hanging on ropes and [[Murdoch]] cuts one of the ropes and the one of the [[kobold]]s was named [[scorb]]. We find a pulley big enough to hold a humanoid. We continue down the mine.

The party is ambushed by a tentacled monster. We force the [[beaked tentacled monster]] to retreat. We continue down the tunnel.

We meet the [[kobold]]s in the mine and they are really nice and [[Bael]] feels bad for killing 2 of them. We agree we are going to take the [[kobold]]s to [[Termalaine]]. We meet [[Trex]].

We find a skull of a [[mind flayer]]. We find a [[psi crystal]].

[[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]] accepts our deal to help the [[kobold]]s work in the mine. We also deliver the body of the [[beaked tentacled monster]] to [[Vellyn Harpelle]].

## Reward
