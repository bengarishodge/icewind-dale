We begin in the [[remorhaz]] den and continue down the left ice tube. We see a figure frozen in the ice. They are covered in gold. We approach the frozen person. They look like a mummy. The mummy is tapping on the glass. [[Bael]] tries to free the mummy's ice. We are ambushed by some [[snow golems]]. ![[snow_golem.png]]We are also attacked by a vampire [[gnoll]] again. We defeat the enemies and speak with the mummy. They are headed to the library. The mummy's name is [[Tutz]].

[[Skam]] shows [[Tutz]] the [[Netherese]] music sheet and he says he heard it at the music hall. We come across a greyish-green stone that isn't covered in ice. [[Bael]] hits it with a hammer and is grappled by a [[mimic]]-of-sorts. We kill the [[mimic]] and [[Tutz]] doesn't stop.
![[mimic_of_sorts.png]]
We follow [[Tutz]] but come to a crossroads and can't find him so we go right. We come to a room of frosty trees. [[Skam]] plucks a purple fruit from the trees. This seems to offend the trees.
![[purple_pear.png]]
We are confronted by a leafy lady person. ![[leafy_lady.png]]
[[Skam]] eat's the fruit and get's poisoned. The leafy lady

this gives you 2 buckets of 4. We water the trees and are able to harvest 16 pears. Each of us feel a tingle after eating the pears. The [[dryad]] says her name is [[Hathwyn]] As we are eating pears, [[Auril]]'s voice sayinhg

You have broken the glacial seal, you know not what have you have unleased. The Netherese rot leaks into my domain once more. You test my patience. I marshal my forces and my cold to drown the city beneath unending frost. Your path to mercy is narrow: shatter the Spindle, or be entombed with the city in ice forevermore!

[[Bael]] is presented this vision.

We take a short rest at the tower near the entrance. We find another tunnel and climb down it. We find a small chest and open it. Inside of it we find 2 potions of superior healing.

We slide the head down the tunnel and continue searching for its body. Clinging to the top of one of the rooms, we stumble into a room through a tunnel. We see 2 drow hiding behind the statues. The drow threaten us and tell us to leave. We decide to ignore them and continue on through the city.

We kill the warriors but the drow mage escapes. We find a thermal cube. There is a half empty bottle of a liquid. [[Professor Skant]] says it elverquist, an alcoholic beverage.

We press on through the tunnel and come across another room. As we enter the room we hear "none shall take my spark". The voice sounds like a goliath. [[Arceus]] probably needs to be here.

Next time:
- continue towards the city
