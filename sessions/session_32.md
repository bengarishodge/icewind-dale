We start this session with a short rest.

We wonder if turning back time would start a time paradox. We discuss many options on our plan of approach.

We leave [[Iriolarthus]]'s office and we head back towards the Ebonchamber. [[Nass Lantomir]] tells us to call her Tessa for now until we resolve some business with the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].

We decide to use featherfall and jump out of the balcony back down to the [[Mythalar]]. We disable the shield before. 

[[Avarice]]'s gargoyles retrieve the spindle from the tower. The ice devil opens a portal and puts the spindle in through. We try to stop them but [[Avarice]] destroys the spindle and frees [[Levistus]].

We beat the absolute shit out of [[Avarice]] who justifies her actions as "she could control [[Levistus]]". [[Auril]] is angry that we used the [[Mythalar]] to start heating up the glacier. She attacks us on her [[roc]] as we make our way to the obelisk to turn back time.

We arrive at the obelisk and [[Auril]] is intercepted by [[Arceus]]. She tells us we must stop melting the city. We are able to defeat [[Auril]] and she reforms as an ice giant.

We continue to fight her in the larger form. [[Auril]] traps [[Bael]] inside of a tiny gem and the party continues to fight. [[Nass Lantomir|Tessa]] destroys her ice form and it compresses down into a compressed ice form.
