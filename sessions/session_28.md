As we continue down the stairs, we are confronted by a creature.
![[scary_stone_golum.png]]
We attack the creature back. We end up killing the creature and when it dies, it turns to stone and shatters.

We continue down the stairs and enter the nearby district. The buildings are more administrative looking. We begin searching the area and we see some elemental hands. They look like they are patrolling.
![[elemental_hands.png]]
We fight and destroy the hands and search the buildings. We find the prison, a drift globe. We continue to the prison in the area.

We find an invisible human and we try to figure out why they are strapped to the table. All we can find as a clue is tools to cut open patients. We untie them and carry them with us. We take the person the the anti-magic room in the tower of abjuration. 

He becomes visible. It is a thin sallow man with one grey and one blue eye. He asks us what is going on and we tell him that it is 2000 years in the future. He tells us he was going to be vivisect him. He introduces himself as [[Faylar]]. He tells us that there is a construct guide. He refused to train in the law of magic. We ask him what he will do now. He s unaware of [[Auril]]. He was looking for a relic from the ruins of Astoria. The high-diviner found a relic a few days before [[Faylar]] was imprisoned.

It turns out that he can't leave the room without falling asleep. We give him some rations and tell him that we will send someone to check on him. He says we should look for [[High Conjureror Demoroth]]. [[Irioh Loath]] is the arch mage and is somewhere in the tower.

We head towards the **tower of conjuration**.
![[tower_of_conjuration.png]]

The area around the tower looks really clean. We head towards the tower. We are able to open the door and head inside. 

There is a chest that looks like an "abracadaberous".

[[Bael]] goes and tries to open a door and disappears. The party gathers that [[Bael]] was teleported somewhere.

We speak with a devil that is trapped by [[High Conjureror Demoroth]]. He asks us to free him for a line of the Arcane Octad. [[Bael]] frees the devil.

"Step 2: Summon a flame in your palm" - Trapped Devil

We leave the tower after eating and head to the library.

**library**
The door is ajar and we head into the building. Inside we see a strange bispecticaled jackel headed humanoid with a mummy and a giant penguin. The jackel headed humanoid is asking the mummy for copies.

We speak with [[Sah'nar]]. [[Skam]] is butthurt about [[Sah'nar]] not helping us fight the mimic. The jackal headed person spins around and says that they are the [[Great Skervinski]]. He is roaming the planes in search of particular books. He is an [[Arcanoloth]].
![[arcanaloth.png]]

 He is looking for one of the books of keeping. It is one of 4 lost tomes.

[[Murdoch]] is passed a note from the penguin. ![[kingsport.png]]
The penguin is named [[Kingsport]]. We talk to [[Sah'nar]] and ask him to wave the library card fee if we go and help the transumtor.

[[Great Skervinski]] places his hand on [[Kingsport]] and they teleport away [[Murdoch]] didn't tell anyone that the penguin was being sexually abused.

We learn that [[Faylar]] is suffering from a sequester spell and would be dispelled using a dispel magic with a dc 17.

We ask for more information on the game chain lightning ball and learn how to play it. We ask about the [[Mythalar]]. We have to perform the rite of the Arcane Octad to get to it. We then would need to attune to it.

We head to the Arboritum

**arboritum**
The leaves are golden and the trees are in a sunken basin. The ceiling is a projection of a false sky. It is flickering between vistas of a storm and a field of stars. There is a massive tree in the center.  [[Skam]] knocks on the tree that has a face carved in it.

The tree is roused from its sleep. We tell him we need some wood for wands and that we are going to do nefarious things with it. The tree seems to like it. [[Skam]] is able to persuade the tree for a wand.

We have fulfilled the first part and get 3 netheroak twigs.

We head towards the house of the arcane

**house of the arcane**
The monumental building and enter through the front door. It opens into a grand hall. There are 8 stained glass windows overlooking a grand auditorium. A bejeweled goblet. The goblet tastes like hot water.

[[Bael]] drinks it and sense magic come overs over him

Charm of the Conjurer. This charm allows you to cast the mage hand cantrip as an action at will. After 24 hours, this charm vanishes from you.

Everything else in the building is destroyed. We find some scrolls and give them all to [[Skam]].

-  2 spellscrolls of stoneskin
- 1 spellscroll of mage armor
- 1 spellscroll of dispel magic

**Bazzar of Bazzars**
We head into the new quarter. It is a loud clatter within the hall. There is a big iron monstrosity in the middle of bazzar. We think it is the golem who's head we have. We sprint back to where we dropped it and try to collect the head. 

There is a floating skull with runes and arcane energy radiating off of it. It was interrogating one of the nothics. [[Arceus]] recognizes the nothic.
![[runed_skull.png]] 

We avoid them and grab the golem's head and head back to the **bazzar**. We come up with a plan to screw the head of the golem back on to the body. We reattach the head to the body and it turns out it is the guide to the city. [[Guide 001]].

Next time:
- Go to music hall
- check out the bazzar
- go to yellow tower on west and red tower to the north.
