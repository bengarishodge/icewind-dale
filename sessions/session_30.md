We begin at the tower of enchantment. 

We head to a tall obelisk. It is cracked from the base to the middle. There are the normal runes but there is another rune for chronomancy. The guide tells that the obelisk is the city's safety measure.

We go to the next tower. It is the tower of evocation.

Standing outside of the tower is [[Dazzan]]. He welcomes us and offers to trade a line for a line. He says that the high wizard of the tower traded the trophy for the line 5. It was [[High Evoker Zaduloos]]. It was just a project.

We leave the tower and speak with [[Vellyn Harpelle]] at the tower of illusion. She says she has line 6. 

We decide to head back and meet up [[Avarice]] at the tower of Yitherin as we remember that she has line 8.

We go up the tower and see [[Avarice]], [[Vellyn Harpelle]] and [[Dazzan]]. There is an Ice devil there. We tell them that they will turn into nothics. The ice devil we freed is now joining our party.

We start sharing the lines we each know about the Arcane Octed and we start preparing the work.

Line 1: "shield thy heart with wand from the netheroak" (From anvil [[High Abjurer Tarth]]) 
Line 2: "Summon a flame in your palm" (From Devil and [[High Conjureror Demoroth]])
Line 3: "a burnt palm loosens the tongue, shed a secret about yourself for all to hear." (from [[High Diviner Apius]])
Line 4: "Coax a secret from another" (from [[High Enchanter Ivarra]])
Line 5: "Quench thy flame in thy palm with ice" (from [[High Evoker Zaduloos]]) 
Line 6: "Hide thyself behind a mask" (from [[High Illusionist Ashimar]])  
Line 7: "Trace a circle with the ashes of the dead" (from [[High Necromancer Kadavix]])
Line 8: "stand firm in thy circle of death and consume poison" (from [[High Transmuter Metaltrah]])


Todo:
1. go get poison and body from tower of necromancy

We go visit [[Laurence]] and he gives us 2 vials of poison and a burned up nothic body. We decide to press on and head to the central tower with the shimmering wall.

We decide to perform the ritual and we can now pass through the shimmering field. We are attacked by a tomb tapper.

We destroy the tomb tapper and attune to the [[Mythalar]].

While attuned we can move the [[Mythalar]].
Use it to cast a control weather spell out to a 50 mile radius
Use it to replenish magic item spell slots

We try to make the weather warmer and the request is denied by another attuned person. We head up to the central tower up through one of the struts. There are some doors and we walk in to a crowded ballroom.

We are tell the security guard that we are looking for [[Iriolarthus]]. The partygoers all seize up and we figure out how to break the simulation. There are some brains in the jars floating and they become hostile and attack us. Also, a massive suit of armor with a brain in a jar.

[[Murdoch]] deescalates the fight and we learn [[Meandra]] is the name of the armored brain. We figured out that they are sentient. We learn that the spindle is on the second floor of the tower. The last time the spindle was activated, the city fell out of the sky because it disabled all magic in the city for 50 years.

We find the secret passage to level 2. We all jump over a chasm.

A bald man with a long purple gown. They are named [[Everlast]], the city's defensive. We find a secret door and go in. We emerge in an icy room. 2 blades coalesce and attack us.

We defeat the swords and escape the wall of force.

We FINALLY take a long rest.
