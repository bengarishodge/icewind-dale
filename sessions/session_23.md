We start our session at the [[White Moose Inn]] and level up. [[Vellyn Harpelle]] tells us that [[Dazzan]] and [[Avarice]] were sent ahead. [[Skam]] signs a contract with [[Jameski]], handing over the [[White Moose Inn]] should he die.

The nomads have blocked our path to the glacier. The speaker of the Elk tribe tells us that there is another tribe that is bolstered and blocking our way because they saw it in their bones.

We set  out and travel to the glacier.
