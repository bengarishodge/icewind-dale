We begin this session in the trial of preservation

A big barbarian guy is walking up to the kid to try and kill the kid. We intervene. The barbarian attacks us!

We kill the barbarian and successfully preserve the bloodline. [[Skam]] gives the kid his business card and invites the kid to the [[White Moose Inn]].

We fill another quadrant of the snowflake.

Snowflakes
- [[Bael]] has cruelty, endurance, preservation
- [[Skam]] has cruelty, isolation, preservation
- [[Murdoch]] has cruelty, preservation
- [[Vellyn Harpelle]] has cruelty, preservation

We fight [[Arch Druid Shandra]] and defeat her. The chamber is opened and we proceed into [[Auril]]'s chamber. There is another frozen over door.

Owl, wolf, goat. [[Nass Lantomir]] compels [[Bael]] to grab the [[Kodasyl of White]]. We hear a disembodied voice.

"Will you court death to receive my blessing?" - [[Auril]]

[[Bael]] accepts the challenge and succeeds. [[Bael]]'s eyes become an icy blue and he gains the [[blessing of the frostmaiden]] but loses the telepathic abilities.

We shuttle the treasure to the [[griffen]]s and fly off of the island. We leave just as [[Auril]] and the [[roc]] mournfully cries as it notices the egg is gone. We fly back to the [[White Moose Inn]].
