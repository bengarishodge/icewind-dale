We start our session speaking to a wraithlike spirit of [[Vlagomir]], the legendary ancestor of [[Arceus]]. He says "no one but the worthy shall take my spark". We push [[Arceus]] to speak with [[Vlagomir]].

[[Arceus]] says he is worthy and we are attacked by shadows and [[Vlagomir]].  [[Arceus]] tries to convince [[Vlagomir]] that he is worth and tries to grab the club.

He is worthy and [[Vlagomir]] wants his body taken to the King's Moot. [[Bael]] eats a purple pear and gains a power. The total powers [[Bael]] has are as follows:

> Charm of Vicious Mockery. This charm allows you to cast the vicious mockery cantrip (5th-level version; save DC 15) as an action. Once used three times, this charm vanishes from you. Uses: 0

> Charm of Purplemancy. This charm allows you to cast the faerie fire spell (violet light only; save DC 15) as a bonus action instead of an action, no components required. Once used three times, this charm vanishes from you. Uses: 0

he eats another
> Charm of Sending. This charm allows you to cast the sending spell as an action, no components required. Once used, this charm vanishes from you. Uses: 0

We continue on through the tunnel and get to the grove.

We continue on and come across a spooky room and see some one eyed creatures. We share secrets and they share secrets.

[[Arceus]] gives one of them a pearl of power and they take it a scamper off. We gather up the things they were playing with and continue on.

[[Bael]] sees an eldritch horror and is dominated. [[Murdoch]] and [[Arceus]] grab [[Bael]]'s catatonic body and drag him to safety. [[Skam]] uses his dispel magic and frees [[Bael]]. We all level up to level 9. We have met up with [[Avarice]], [[Vellyn Harpelle]] and [[Dazzan]].

We tell the wizards about the spindel and that the frost maiden wants it destroyed.

We continue into the city. We find the crashed city. We sketch a rough map. We see a bunch of dead drow near a horrific dead construct. We start checking out the towers.

Amphitheater
We head towards an amphitheater which has static air. There is a tiny glittering object on a pedestal. We play a game and lose.

School of Abjuration tower

![[school_of_abjuration_tower.png]]

We go to a tower and and enter it. The building has a lot of blue. We climb the tower and find a stone double door, carved with inhumane precision. There are scary creatures carved into the door.
![[slug_horror.png]]
![[slug_horror_2.png]]
[[Skam]] casts knock on the door and is shrunk down inside of a gem and vanishes. He vanished inside of a cerulean blue gem.

We open the door and walk into the room. there is an upward leaning staircase and columns on either side of the room. There are 5 teal skinned people at the base of the stairs.

![[teal_defender_mage.png]]
![[teal_defender_monk.png]]

We decide to fight these folks. We kill all of them. 

We talk with a magic hungry anvil and [[Bael]] donates the ram ring.
[[Skam]] donates a spice pouch.

We see some saphires and [[Skam]] is trapped inside of one of the gems.
And the anvil says the following.

The right of the Arcane Octad (there are 7 lines)

Line 1: "shield thy heart with wand from the netheroak" (From anvil) 
Line 2: "Summon a flame in your palm" (From Devil and [[High Conjureror Demoroth]])
Line 3: "a burnt palm loosens the tongue, shed a secret about yourself for all to hear." (from [[High Diviner Apius]])
Line 4: "Coax a secret from another" (from [[High Enchanter Ivarra]])
Line 5: (from [[High Evoker Zaduloos]]) 
Line 6: (from [[High Illusionist Ashimar]])  
Line 7: "Trace a circle with the ashes of the dead" (from [[High Necromancer Kadavix]])
Line 8: (from )

Next time:
- we decend the tower and continue searching the city.
- we should search the suburbs and the wooded area.
