We begin our session by by [[Skam]] pulling out [[Nass Lantomir]]'s corpse and reincarnates a new tiefling. We all reintroduce ourselves to the new version of [[Nass Lantomir|Nass]].

There is a double door with the gem where we fought the swords. We go the doors and enter a hallway that opens to another large area. [[Murdoch]] hangs back as the rest of the party enters the larger room. [[Arceus]] freezes and [[Bael]] tries to figure out what is going on and lets everyone know there is transmutation magic.

We go through the darkness of each door and there is a vortex of glowing stars. The constellations move and there are high backed chairs. There is a star missing from the constellation but we don't know what the star that is missing is called. There are three doors in the room but no specific markings tell us what they lead to.

We pick the lock on the door and it opens up to a balcony. [[Auril]]'s forces are attacking the city.

We open another door and enter a library looking room. All the scrolls are scattered on the floor. [[Bael]] doesn't find anything.

[[Nass Lantomir]] opens another door and there is a 10-foot tall object in the other room. The party enters the room with the object.

There are some notes on a table near.

We look for information in the library. It takes about an hour and we are looking for info on the [[Ebenstar]] (missing star from the constellation). There is a tome with 8 points on it. Master [[Iriolarthus]] open's his study when those empowered by the goblet sit in the correct chair of the [[Ebenstar]]. We find a scroll of the comet. https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2188399-scroll-of-the-comet. [[Nass Lantomir]] casts a divination spell

We enter through the portal into an office.

There are some nothics and a flying skull. We stare at eachother for 18 seconds and then the skull attack us.
