We begin this session in [[Easthaven]]. In the evening we host a free food to gain some positive reputation with the townsfolk of [[cauldron of plenty]]. We go to the brig and speak with [[Sephic Calteroh]] and get the reason why he killed all of those people. He says he was commanded by [[Auril]]. He says that he shipwrecked on an island and was taken by the frost and that is how he met [[Auril]]. This island was on the north west coast. The captain refused to leave his treasure.

We also decide that we want to put [[cauldron of plenty]] in the [[White Moose Inn]]. We all level up to level 4. We spend the night in the [[White Lady Inn]]. 

We buy a pair of shackles [[Captain Imdra Arlaggath]]. We leave to [[Bryn Shander]] and go to the militia and speak with [[Sheriff Markham Southwell]] and turn in [[Sephic Calteroh]]. We also learn that it is the monthly lottery is at the end of the day. His trial will happen soon. We finish [[(completed) ten towns murders]] quest. [[Sheriff Markham Southwell]] reports that he received a letter from the goblin camp. The [[goblin camp]] is far to the southwest of [[Bryn Shander]]. They ask to help [[extract the goblins from the camp]], their [[Chief Yarb-Gnock]]. We decide that we could probably help them.

We head to the [[Black Iron Blades]] store and try to buy some better gear. We also learn that the [[knucklehead trout]] prices have skyrocketed. Many people are on the street begging for food.

We go to [[Nass Lantomir]] and update her on our travels at the [[North Look Inn]]. We let her know that we didn't get the orb from [[Vellyn Harpelle]]. We also tell her that we did not find [[Dazzan]]'s journal (lie). We tell her that [[Avarice]] found the [[Netherese]]. We try to quit [[Nass Lantomir]]'s party and decide that we want to help one of the other wizards. The says some curses and walks away.

[[Karas]] tells us that he had a vision and he needs to go the temple of [[Lethander]]. We all follow him to the temple. [[Karas]] speaks to the priestess and they connect over the holy symbol. He says he is looking for a man named [[Macreadus]]. He left some time ago looking for a way to end this eternal winter. He is currently researching at the [[old black cabin]] of the [[Ten Towns]]. We start the [[find the pigheaded priest]] quest.

We decide that we want to feed the folks of the town. We serve all 120 portions from the [[cauldron of plenty]]. We see [[Jameski]] walk up to get food. [[Skam]] tries to get [[Jameski]] to sign a work contract, which contains an evil subsection that [[Jameski]] did not notice.

We decide to head north towards the [[old black cabin]]. We stop in [[Termalaine]] and everyone is hating life. We decide to talk with [[Vellyn Harpelle]] and inform her that [[Dazzan]] is dead. We tell her that she can come with us on our way to [[old black cabin]]. We go and speaker [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]], newest speaker of [[Termalaine]]. We tell them that we are there to talk about "money". On [[Sergeant Hathlen Arkora]]'s lapel, he has a black rock. It is made of obsidian. He is a member of [[Obsidian Holdings]] and is dealing in slavery. This triggers some really visceral hatred in [[Bael]]. This makes [[Bael]] really mad.

The party decides to stop by the [[Termalaine Mine]] and feed some slaves and speak with [[Speaker Orus]] and ask him if we can help him retake control. [[Worthy]] tries to convince some of the guards to revolt against the speaker. We spend the night in the inn and plan the revolt. [[Skam]] disguises himself convinces all the guards that they are getting a raise and they gather in the mouth of the mine. [[Worthy]] takes the opportunity to blast all the slaver guards with fireball. We kill all the guards and begin freeing the guards. We march to the speaker's residence.

[[Speaker Orus]] is put back in charge of [[Termalaine]] again.

Next time
