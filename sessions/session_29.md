We begin our session in the Grand Bazzar.

We search the bazzar and find some art in an art shop

- Painting of a dot in the center of a white canvas.
- Painting of a meadow before the phage

We look for spellcasting components shop. We find 5 bags of diamond dust and a green wizard hat.
- It is a hat of many spells

**Hall of silk**
We go to the hall of silk. It is guarded by a bunch of teal skinned guards. We enter.

There are 4 large spiders lurking in the rafters spinning bolts of silk. An elaborately dressed figure appears. [[Silk Smith Mixyol]]. They sell illusory silk robes. It is 250GP per robe. [[Skam]] tries to buy a robe and decides on a 3 piece power suit. It takes about 30 minutes.

We go to the tower of divination. 

**tower of divination**

There is a large number of nothics watching us ever since we left the bazzar. The door is welded shut. We push the door down and are able to push our ways in.

We enter the tower. There are 3 teal humanoids stand defensively inside. We tell them we are just looking for the next line in the  "poem". 

The party touches various objects in the room and gets some temporary powers. We are attacked by a bunch of nothics. [[Skam]] is able to pick the lock guarded by the magus and sees a frog creature.

We kills all the nothics and head up the stairs. We see [[High Diviner Apius]] who is looking for a spellbook. [[Murdoch]] looks through her telescope and sees the spellbook teetering on the edge of a really deep pit.

We find her spellbook and head towards the tower of necromancy.

 There is a nothic in the center of the room, restrained and a brain floating in a jar.
 ![[lab_assistant_laurence.png]]
The brain turns towards us and greets us nicely. [[Bael]] and [[Skam]] are very happy to see this brain. The brain introduces themselves as [[Laurence]], the lab assistant. We agree to help them with a procedure to make a new helper.

He asks us to restrain the nothic using topour (chlorophorm). [[Skam]] and [[Murdoch]] slice out the nothic's brain and puts it in a jar. We are allowed to go upstairs and talk with the master.

There is a well preserved body in the corner of the room. There is a gemstone in the bones. [[Bael]] and [[Murdoch]] inspect the body of [[High Necromancer Kadavix]]. [[Skam]] inspects the gem in the corner.

[[High Necromancer Kadavix]] asks us to find out what happened to his lover in the tower of enchantment. [[High Enchanter Ivarra]]. [[High Necromancer Kadavix]] grabs a diamond and agrees to come with us. While possessing [[Skam]], he resurrects [[High Necromancer Kadavix]]. 

We ask him for the line and he writes the line on a paper and puts it in his pocket.

We warn the [[High Diviner Apius]] about the skull, named [[Iriolarthus]]. She leaves and agrees to speak with [[Avarice]] and the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] before trying to escape.

We head towards the tower of enchantment.

**tower of enchantment**
![[tower_of_enchantment.png]]

We arrive at the tower and try to enter. We have [[High Necromancer Kadavix]] lead the way.  The party enters the tower and is asailed by bane. There are several faux plants.

We walk across the room and are ambushed by 2 mimics. We defeat them and we see [[High Enchanter Ivarra]] emerge from the door. She says that she hasn't seen another person in a very long time.

Inside the room there is an alien device hooked up to a metal box. She says that the device is called a hippokyrus chamber. [[Bael]], and [[Skam]] feels like he is charmed and has to defend whatever is in the box. A creature spills out of the chamber and attacks the party.
![[gelatinous_blob.png]]We defeat the blob but it escapes. We find a bookshelf with a secret book with door behind it. There is an emaciated human wizard staring into the distance. We head up to her and examine her. We deduce that the [[High Enchanter Ivarra]]'s memories have been wiped.

We are able to restore her memories and remove her trauma.  We convince them to head to the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].

[[Avarice]] says she has another line (of transmutation)

Next Time:
- Head to the music hall.
- Clear the rest of the towers.
