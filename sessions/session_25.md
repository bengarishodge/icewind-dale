This session, [[Pandora]] and [[Arceus]] join the party again.

We decide to follow the where the hyena went. We go through the tower into a tunnel to the left. We stumble upon a head made out of iron with glowing eyes.

[[Professor Skant]] says it is an [[iron golem]]. We ask the golem if he needs help and he blinks once. We derive that he saw the mist go towards the east. We roll the head towards the east out of the room. We arrive at another room with icicles. There are lots of them.

From the tunnel on the side of the room, we hear some cackling. [[Murdoch]] enters the room and finds an army of small misshapen ice sculptures. We prop up the [[iron golem]] and tell him we'll be back. [[Bael]] picks up one of the sculptures and they shatter. the group heads towards the cackling. We enter a room that stinks of death. We enter the room and try to cross a narrow bridge. We are attacked by a group of red-eyed [[kobold]]s.

As we are fighting the [[kobold]]s, a massive [[gnoll]] attacks us. We defeat all of the enemies.

[[Bael]] throws the [[gnoll]] down the chasm. [[Bael]] also cuts off one of the [[kobold]]'s head and takes it with him. We continue down the tunnel and find a room of skulls. We desecrate the skulls and leave. We head back to the [[iron golem]] head and go south. We come across a body of a fabeled stone giant, [[Vlagomir]].

We find a carefully excavated hole and slide into it. We reach the end of the tunnel and are attacked by two massive worm things!

We continue to fight the massive worms and another even bigger creature attacks the party. They are called [[remorhaz]]. [[Pandora]] turns [[Skam]] into a t-rex and he fucks up the [[remorhaz]].

We collect the [[remorhaz]] eggs and harvest the mother [[remorhaz]] heart.

Next time, continue down the left tunnel.
